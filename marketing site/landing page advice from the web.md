1. Design for first-time visitors. Have them travel down a specific path that has been planned for them. The purpose is to get them to come back to the website. The two biggest drivers are retargeting and email.
2. Have a gripping headline. Make a promise, have an action word, have "you" or imply it. "Guaranteed to increase your organic traffic"
3. Have at least one visual element at the top of the page. It should speak to your value prop or demonstrate something.
4. List some benefits. Not too many - Three concrete benefits, or maybe three sets of three.
5. Testimonials with head shots.
6. Add features. Features are not benefits, and they're further down your page. Done well if there are features that set you apart
7. Have four items or fewer in your top nav. Home, tour, pricing, "Why X"
8. Have an exit path at the end of every page. Some button or something that takes you to the next step in the flow
9. Limit the number of links and buttons on the page
10. Put everything (within reason) in the footer

## 5 landing page mistakes indie hackers keep doing over and over

1. No social proof
2. Using images that add nothing to your story
3. Way too much text, lack of focus
4. No "about" page. Add bits of your story. Explain who you are, your ethos, etc.
5. Weak call to action. Add risk reversals, add subtle animations, a color that makes it stand out, and actionable text that expresses both the intent and what to expect.
