# Meta descriptions

An element within the `<head>` element that provides a machine-readable description of the page.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="the text of the meta description" />
</head>
```

## Usages

Google uses the first 160 characters of the meta description in their search results.

Accordingly, Chrome's Lighthouse integration penalizes you 10 points (at the time of writing
this) if you do not have a meta description.
