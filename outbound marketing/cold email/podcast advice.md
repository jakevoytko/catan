Make a sequence for cold emailing promising prospects.

* Identify the customer segment
* Identify the two biggest problems that they have
* **First email**: "In talking to other Xs, the thing they tell me is that the two biggest problems they have are A and B. Which of these is for you?"
* **Second email**: "If your problem is A, which we talked about in the last email, here's a free resource to help you solve the problem"
* **Third email**: "If your problem was B, here's a free resource to help you solve that problem"
* **Fourth email**: "Maybe we can help you solve the problem. Why don't we talk?"
