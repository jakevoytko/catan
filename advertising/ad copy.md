I found a lot of good general purpose advice in here
**Mistakes:**
- Talking about yourself instead of the reader. The reader doesn't care about you
- Not testing variations
- Dry copy. Your reader is a human
- Not qualifying the reader
- No call to action
- Features over benefits
- Not telling stories

**Answer these questions**
- Why me?
- Why you?
- Why this?
- Why now?

**Things to do**
- Have a very clear "avatar" defined.
- One problem, one solution. Don't sell 8 different things
- Use testimonials whenever you can
- Speak naturally - read the ad out loud and edit if it sound wrong
- Avoid big blocks of text
- Read back every sentence and ask yourself, "So what?"

**It's often cheap to buy all ad inventory for niche subreddits**
**Gather new product feedback**

Very clearly dated, but still has good advice.

**Google**: More likely to convert if they see their search query in the ad title copy. The 25 characters of the title are the most
important, this is what skimmers read. Don't make false promises. Make claims with verifiable facts. Don't make hollow claims like
"#1", but instead explain why (Translation service might have "Over 70 source/target languages").

**Twitter**: Announcing a new thing? Use the word "New." Words like "hurry", "fast", "now", and "limited time" lower CPA

**LinkedIn**: Directly address audience pain points. Explain why audiences might be experiencing a problem (5 reasons your
storage snapshots aren't working). Precisely target and qualify buyers - if you know specific traits of your audience, then tailor
the message to them. (Are you a marketer using AdWords to generate Salesforce leads?). Include direct and persuasive CTA
